    "question": "Peter is eating chips. Each chip is 10 calories. A bag has 24 chips and costs $2. If he wants to eat 480 calories, how much does he have to spend on chips?",
    "predicted_answer": "He needs 480 calories because 480 / 10 = <<480/10=24>>24\nHe needs 480 calories because 24 / 2 = <<24/2=4>>4\n#### 4",
    "gold_answer": "Each bag has 240 calories because 24 x 10 = <<24*10=240>>240\nHe needs two bags because 480 / 240 = <<480/240=2>>2\nIt will cost $4 because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4\n#### 4"
